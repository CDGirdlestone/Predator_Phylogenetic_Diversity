Trait mediated effects are often trasmitted by chemical cues which insects detect. Is it possible that insects simply don't detect close relatives? an experiment with a more diverse group would be necessary to tell these apart. 

If that is true, communities with low PD are unlikely to show a phylogenetic effect -- and within a diverse regional pool, local patches which have higher PD would show less total preation than pools which are smaller.
