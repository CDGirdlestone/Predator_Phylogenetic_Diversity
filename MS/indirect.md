Indirect interactions among predators are common in many communities, which
means that the total amount of top-down control cannot be predicted by summing
the contributions of individual predator species [@Sih1998a]. For example,
decreasing predator richness has been shown to increase herbivory in a three-
  level kelp food web [@Byrnes2006]. The complex traits that underlie such
species interactions ("higher-order" interactions, Sih *et al.* [-@Sih1998a])
may also correlate with phylogeny; if so, then phylogenetic diversity will be
a better predictor of ecosystem function than richness alone [@Cadotte2009].
The effect of predators on prey may also be non-additive, the result of
indirect interactions either with prey species or other predators: prey
species may respond to the presence of one predator by a behavioural shift
that increases the predation by another predator population [@Carey2010a].
These trait-mediated indirect effects (TMII, [@Werner2003]) can be difficult
to predict; however phylogenetic relatedness has been suggested as a possible
means of predicting the combined effect of predators [@Naisbit2011]


Other predators constrain
distribution not only through direct interactions, but also colonization:
predators may use cues of prey, competitors, or intra-guild predators when
selecting a habitat patch [@Chase2009a;@McCauley2008a;@Srivastava2008].


 After
colonization, patterns of co-occurrence may be further modified by intraguild
predation [@Lounibos2008;@Juliano2009] or competition [@Fincke1997].

For example, some predators are
gape-limited, and can swallow any prey smaller than their mouth; these predators
typically broaden their diet as they grow (e.g., larvae of Odonata)
[@Werner1984].  Such ontogenetic changes in diet can radically influence
food web structure [@Moya-Larano2011]. Other predators (e.g. Leeches, or
Diptera:Tabanidae) are "piercing-sucking" predators [@Bay1974] and may be more
general consumers at all life stages, since they can feed on larger prey
individuals even at very early predator life stages.
