Indirect interactions among predators are common in many communities, which
means that the total amount of top-down control cannot be predicted by summing
the contributions of individual predator species [@Sih1998a]. For example,
decreasing predator richness has been shown to increase herbivory in a three-
  level kelp food web [@Byrnes2006]. The complex traits that underlie such
species interactions ("higher-order" interactions, Sih *et al.* [-@Sih1998a])
may also correlate with phylogeny; if so, then phylogenetic diversity will be
a better predictor of ecosystem function than richness alone [@Cadotte2009].
The effect of predators on prey may also be non-additive, the result of
indirect interactions either with prey species or other predators: prey
species may respond to the presence of one predator by a behavioural shift
that increases the predation by another predator population [@Carey2010a].
These trait-mediated indirect effects (TMII, [@Werner2003]) can be difficult
to predict; however phylogenetic relatedness has been suggested as a possible
means of predicting the combined effect of predators [@Naisbit2011]
