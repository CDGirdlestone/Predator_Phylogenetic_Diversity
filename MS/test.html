<!-- 
Predators are present in most ecosystems, and are important functional groups in determining ecosystem function.  While predator-prey relationships have been studied for a long time, we understand little of the effects of predator diversity on whole communites and ecosystems.  Phylogenetic diversity of plants may correlates well with community level variables, but as yet studies of predator combinations rarely use measures of predator phylogenetic diversity.  In our study we present results from patterns of predator co-occurance, feeding trials, finally a community-level experiment in which we directly manipulated phylogenetic diversity of predators.  In each we ask if the phylogenetic distance between predators is related to similarity, or if diversity is correlated with effect on ecosystem function
.
Decreasing predator richness has been shown to increase herbivory [@Byrnes2006] in a three-level kelp food web.  As these authors point out, the effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning is better known for lower tropic levels, rather than predators.   
Predator combinations can have many different outcomes.  From the perspective of ecosystem function it is important to consider whether these result in more or less top-down control.  Predator effects can be direct via changes in consumption, indirect via non-consumptive effects.  in other words, it can be via the effects of predators on each other, or on their prey, and directly or indirectly.  Therefore, in our experiment we tracked both predator and prey survival to the end of the experiment

for example, predators can kill each other, or decrease feeding rates.

<p>We test three related hypotheses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>species co-occurance</em>: closely-related predators occur together more frequently than less-related predators, due to their similar habitat requirements. Additionally, very closely related species never co-occur because they are too similar.</p></li>
<li><p><em>diet similarity</em>: similarity in diet (as measured by feeding trials) decreases with phylogenetic distance.</p></li>
<li><p><em>ecosystem-level effects</em>: similarity in the effect of predators on whole ecosystems declines with phylogenetic distance. Additionally, the non-additive effect of predators will have a greater absolute value when their phylogenetic diversity is larger.</p></li>

<!-- 
We combined predators together in species pairs that represented a
range of relatedness: congeners (two congeneric damselflies,
*Leptagrion andromache* and *Leptagrion elongatum*), two
insects (a damselfly, *L. elongatum* and a predatory fly
(Diptera: Tabanidae)) and two invertebrates (*L. elongatum* and
leeches).  We also included these four species in monoculture, along
with a predator-free control (8 treatments, n=5).  Combinations were
substitutive, maintaining the same amount of predator metabolic
capacity (biomass raised to the power of 0.69, predicting the scaling
of metabolism with body mass [@Brown2004]) in each.  Response
variables included the rate of decomposition of leaves, bromeliad
growth and insect emergence.  This experiment allows the estimation of
the effect of each predator species from monoculture treatments, as
well as the detection of non-additive effects in predator
combinations. 

In Feburary 2011, bromeliads between 90 and 200ml were collected, thoroughly
washed and soaked for 12 hours in a tub of water.  They were then hung for 48
hours to dry.  One bromeliad dissected after this procedure contained no
insects.

Each bromeliad was supplied with dried leaves, simulating natural detritus
inputs from the canopy.  We enriched these leaves with N-15 by fertilizing
five (Jabuticaba, *Plinia cauliflora*) plants with 40ml/pot/day of 5g/L
ammonium sulphate containing 10 percent atom excess of N15. *duration*.
started on 27/1/2011 Whole leaves were then picked from plants and air-dried
until constant weight, and then soaked for three days and the water discarded.
About 1.5 g of leaves were placed in each bromeliad (1.5006 ± `r
sd(pd$mass.g.)`).

Each bromeliad was stocked with a representative insect community. The
densities of each prey taxon were calculated from a 2008 observational
dataset, using data from bromeliads of similar size to those in our experiment
(DS Srivastava, upub. data).  All densities used were within the range of
these calculated abundances, and all experimental bromeliads received the same
insect community.  Halfway through the experiment, insects were added to
bromeliads a second time.

After addition of the prey community, all bromeliads were enclosed
with a mesh cage and checked daily for emergence of adults.

<!--    Our central hypothesis is that the phylogenetic relationships among
predatory taxa in this system can be used to interpret their ecology.
Specifically, we test the hypothesis that phylogenetic relatedness is
negatively correlated with probability of co-occurance, positively with diet
similarity.  Consequently, we might predict that ecosystem function peaks at
some intermediate level of phylogenetic diversity -- where predators occur but
where their similarity creates complementarity.  -->

<p>Within the 2008 observational dataset, we identified 14 species as predators. These predators vary in taxonomic relatedness: from congeners -- <em>Bezzia</em> sp. (Diptera:Ceratopogonidae) with two species and <em>Leptagrion</em> sp. (Odonata:Coenagrionidae) with three -- to confamilials (three species of Tabanidae and two of Empididae, all Diptera). Three families of Diptera are represented by a single species each: Dolichopodidae, Corethrellidae and Chironomidae. The deepest taxonomic divide is between all insects present and a species of leech (Annelida:Hirudinidae). Node age data was available for all but the shallowest nodes of the tree, where either a lack of taxonomic information (e.g. Tabanidae) or a lack of phylogenetic study (e.g. <em>Leptagrion</em>) prevented more information from being included. These branches were left as polytomies, and were all assigned identical, arbitrary and short branch lengths (15 Mya).</p>
<p>We obtained node age estimates for all 7 internal nodes of the tree. These were usually provided by only a single study, with more studies available for deeper nodes: Insecta--Hirudina (543 to 700 Mya, n=5 studies), Odonata--Tabanidae (151 to 543 Mya, n=4 studies) and Tabanidae--Diptera (151 to 543 Mya, n=7 studies). We used the median estimate of age for these nodes.</p>
<p>In 2008, insects were counted and measured in an observational study of 25 bromeliads. Across all bromeliads, predator species differed widely in metabolic capacity, from 0.0062 for a species of Empididae, to 0.4804 for the abundant predator <em>Leptagrion andromache</em>. Predators often co-occured in bromeliads (<span class="math">3. 52 ± 3. 11</span> species per plant). However, the euclidian distance between the total metabolic capacity of two predators did not show any relationship with phylogenetic distance between them (F<sub>1,89</sub>=1.5558, p=0.22).</p>
<h3 id="diet-similarity-and-phylogenetic-distance">diet similarity and phylogenetic distance</h3>
<p>We conducted 237 feeding trials of 8 predator taxa fed 14 prey taxa. However, due to the rarity of some taxa many predator-prey pairs were not possible; we tested 46 pairwise combinations. Most trials were replicated at least 5 times, but the number of replicates for various combinations ranged from 1 to 11. Two damselflies, <em>Leptagrion andromache</em> and <em>Leptagrion elongatum</em>, showed the higest rates of prey consumption (prey consumed in 94% and 67% of trials, respectively).</p>
<p>All predators showed a very generalist diet breadth, consuming nearly all species offered to them. However, more phylogenetically distant predators preferred slightly different diets, as measured by euclidian distance between feeding trial outcomes (F<sub>1,19</sub>=5.16, p=0.035) Regression was weighted by the number of trials conducted.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem-level-effects-and-phylogenetic-distance">Ecosystem-level effects and phylogenetic distance</h3>
<p>In our manipulative experiment, we placed a standardized prey community into bromeliads and measured five response variables: the total survivorship (both emerged during experiment and found as larvae at the end) of all prey, the %N15 which was transferred into bromeliad tissue, bromeliad growth, coarse detritus decomposition and fine organic matter production. Predators had a large effect on prey survivorship: on average all predator treatments showed 51% lower prey emerging or surviving as larvae relative to the predator-free control. Nitrogen transport to bromeliad leaves was slightly decreased relative to controls (-11%), and was only higher than the control in treatments including Tabanid predators. We found a similar pattern for plant growth: on average, predators had a -18% effect on growth of bromeliad leaves (mm), though Tabanids seemed to create a slight increase. The decomposition of coarse detritus and production of fine organic matter showed no obvious pattern related to the mere presence of predators.</p>
<p>Predator combinations tended to have an increased effect on our response variables relative to predators alone. Approximately 14% more prey survived in polyculture, on average, compared to all monocultures. Effects were smaller for Nitrogen (8%) and bromeliad growth (11%). Fine particulate organic matter was produced 29% more when predators were present in combination.</p>
<p>Our experimental design allows us to estimate the non-additive effect of predator species pairs on whole communities of prey, and the functioning of the bromeliad ecosystem. We used randomization tests to test the hypothesis that increased phylogenetic distance between members of a predator pair results in a greater magnitude of nonadditive effect. We contrasted the differences of the mean individual predator treatments from the control with the mean difference of their pairwise combination from the control. We found the greatest effect for prey survival: while effects of <em>L. andromache</em> and <em>L. elongatum</em> in combination were quite similar to the effect of either alone, when <em>L. elongatum</em> was placed in the same plant as either a Tabanid larva or leeches, on average 5 more prey (18% of total prey community) survived till the end of the experiment (Fig 3). This effect was smaller among the other variables, most of which showed confidence intervals from the randomization test which overlap 0.</p>
