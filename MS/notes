note that in the calculations we only calculate detrus mass for the 'coarse' detritus which we placed in plants ourselves (ie. not for the so-called 'extra' material that stayned in there.)

## notes on pd-ef writing

Can mechanisitc models be fit to this data as well? For example, models which desccribe how the probabilitites of co-occurance change 

more phylo distance == saturating dissimilarity in diet.  How dissimmilar might diets GET in this ecosystem? 

What if phylogenetic information about the prey animals is somehow helpful?

predators all eat the same things?  compare the prey which survived to a random sample of prey types.  

Is there an equation for the amount of predation we should see if there is complementarity, etc?

parameters --- related to phylogenetic distance?  


co-occurrance: oviposition decisions and spatail variation within foodwebs.  Spatial variations in metacommunities
- spatial variation in foodwebs is related to predator preferences, etc.  

assembly in a metacommunity with non-consumptive effects



% %\paragraph{Predators have important effects on ecosystems, and
%   predator combinations could have either greater or smaller effects}
% Predators play a critical role in many ecosystems; their presence can
% have profound effects on community assembly \citep{Chase2009} and
% enhance nutrient cycling \citep{Schmitz2010}.  I mean hopefully.
% Predator combinations are known to have several possible outcomes --
% predators may interfere with each other, decreasing prey mortality, or
% may compliment each other, causing an increase in prey mortality.
% Such changes in the strength of top-down control could affect both the
% species composition and the function of the entire community.
% However, few experiments have attempted to link predator-predator
% interactions to whole community effects.

% \paragraph{Predators may have both direct and indirect effects on each
%   other and on lower trophic levels.} Predators may interact with each
% other directly, or indirectly via the prey community.  Intraguild
% predation among diverse predator assemblages is well known
% (REF). Predators may also respond to each other's presence, by
% altering feeding rate or foraging behaviour. Similarly, predators may
% affect each other via their effects on prey.  Predators which consume
% the same prey species will be in strong competition to each other,
% while those selecting different prey will compete weakly.  Predators
% may also affect prey behaviour via trait-mediated effects
% \citep{Schmitz2007}. There are many possible indirect trait mediated
% interactions between diverse predators: for example, diverse predator
% combinations could have a stronger negative effect on prey behaviour
% than either alone, resulting in a net decrease in predation.
% Alternatively, prey avoidance of one predator may increase predation
% by another, resulting in a net increase in predation. However
% predators interact, their combined effect will change the
% density and feeding rate of their prey, which in turn will affect
% lower tropic levels (including the basal resource).  

% \paragraph{predation rate affects ecosystem function} As predators
% consume prey and/or alter the behaviour of that prey, the effects will
% be felt throughout the food web.  Decreased prey density or feeding
% rate will result in an increase in the standing crop of the next-lower
% trophic level; these effects will therefore propagate down to all
% trophic levels.  Theoretical work has demonstrated that the effect of
% predation attenuates down the food chain, and that the ultimate
% effects on the basal resource depend on the number of tropic links
% (Loreau). In a meta-analysis of predator effects on 13 detritus-based
% chains, \citet{Schmitz2007} suggested that food-chain length
% determines the effect of predators on decomposition rates in
% detritus-based food webs. The overall effects of predation on ecosystem
% function will therefore depend on trophic structure. Previous work in
% Costa Rican bromeliads has demonstrated that an increase in nutrient
% cycling in bromeliads occurs when predators are present
% \citep{Ngai2006}.  This may be caused by a decrease in successful
% emergence by detritivores, a process that would otherwise remove
% nitrogen from the system.

\paragraph{Despite studies of the effects of food chain length, we know little
about the complex effects of multiple predators at once.}%see
                                %meta-analyses: Cardinale et al
                                %(Nature)& Balvanera et al Ecol Lett
                                %(06 or 07) and A.Wilby's paper on
                                %multiple pred effects.
The effect of a diverse predator assemblage will depend on the
diversity of functional traits represented, including diet breadth,
feeding mode and habitat requirements
\citep{Schmitz2009}. \citet{Ives2005} suggest that predator-prey
interactions can lead to increased ecosystem function through niche
complementarity (e.g. different feeding modes, habitats or diet
breadths). \citet{Griffin2011} found that rates of predation increased
in strength and temporal stability in salt marshes when two species of
predatory crabs were present. \citet{Byrnes2006}, in a study in a
kelp-based food web, found that predators had an additional effect on
decreasing feeding by surviving herbivores; predator combinations
showed an additive increase.  Despite a large number of studies, we
still know little about how predator diversity might affect ecosystem
function.

\paragraph{If relevant traits are conserved within clades;
  phylogenetic diversity could be a useful predictor of predator
  functional diversity and ecosystem-level effects.} Phylogenetic
diversity gives us a robust and inclusive measure of diversity that
includes many possibly unmeasured traits, and therefore might predict
ecosystem function more closely than simply species richness
(Srivastava \emph{et al.}  in prep). For example, in a study by
\citet{Maherali2007}, diverse mycorrhizal communities had both higher
species richness and greater function (plant biomass) after a year,
due to complementarity between fungi with high phylogenetic
diversity. To our knowledge, similar experiments with animals have yet
to be done. There is tantalizing evidence that such manipulations
would reveal an important effect: for example, detritus processing
chains (facilitation among detritivores caused by each species
breaking the food source into sizes suitable for another
\citep{heard1994processing}) often include members of different
clades, since the feeding mode (and hence role within the processing
chain) varies more among than within higher-level taxonomic groups
\citep{Merritt2009}.

% While phylogenetic community ecology has made important progress in
% understanding the mechanisms of plant community diversity and
% function, work at higher trophic levels remains uncommon.
% Phylogenetic diversity of animals has recently become the subject of
% observational studies; \citet{Vamosi2009} survey 39 studies of
% phylogenetic community structure and report only 6 studies of animals
% (15\%).  Experiments which manipulate consumer phylogenetic diversity
% are even rarer. 

Non-additive effects of predator combinations may also increase with
PD. For example, intraguild predation results in decreased predator
density and a corresponding indirect effect on consumers. The
probability of intraguild predation may increase with phylogenetic
distance, since more dissimilar predators are more likely to be
different enough in body size and feeding mode that they are able to
successfully capture each other. Non-additive effects may also arise
if prey behaviour is altered by the presence of one predator in such a
way that the probability of capture by another species is enhanced or
decreased. For example, the threat of predaceous Plecoptera causes
stream insects to move to exposed rocks where they are easier prey for
fish \citep{Soluk1997}.

We attempted to measure the effects of predator combinations on
ecosystem function.  We approached this questions in three parts:
first, we quantified patterns of co-occurrence between predators, using
observational datasets.  Then, we attempted to measure diet breadth in
all species via a series of feeding trials.  Finally, we conducted a
community-level manipulation of predator phylogenetic diversity to
estimate its effects on prey emergence and ecosystem function.

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:analy}

%% sections about the the analysis for the food web and co-occurance data

We tested our hypotheses about the effects of predator combinations by
comparing response variables of predator polycultures with the average
response of the two corresponding predator monocultures. Intraguild
predation should be visible in our experiment as different levels of
predator survival, while synergistic interactions among predators
would result in a higher prey mortality than in predator
monocultures. We used randomization tests to estimate the non-additive
effect of predator combinations.  In the presence of non-additive
effects, the effect of predator combinations should differ
significantly from the mean of the two monoculture treatments.  We
calculated this quantity by first calculating treatment means for each
experimental treatment.  Then, we averaged the two monoculture means
and subtracted this number from the corresponding polyculture mean.
We repeated this procedure for each pair of species represented in the
polyculture.

\section{Results}

Prey suvivorship varied among treatments, with the control showing the
highest emergence rate (number of surviving or emerging prey insects)
confirming that predator treatments reduced the successful emergence
of prey. Randomization tests confirmed that predator combinations had
more prey survivorship than monoculture treatments \ref{fig:prednonadd}.

In fact, a better analysis for taht data might be to compare the relative probability of eatin a certain prey species for leeches, and compare to same for Leptagrion.  In other words: if Leptagrion, leeches, and tabanids had eaten the same number as they had originally, but these were randomly distributed among all prey -- would we see the same pattern which we found?  or a stronger or weaker one?

weighting feeding-trial regression by the metabolic capacity of predators, rather than sample size?  Does it correlate with feeding rate?  marginal distribution / rank-abd plot showing variation in metabolic capacity among predators?

A mechanistic model for the effects on the whole community, elegantly tied together with the results of the previous sections -- the differences in feeding rate, diet breadth, but no difference in habitat preference.
