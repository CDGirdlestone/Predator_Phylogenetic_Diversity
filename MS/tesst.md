This is what **we the people** think about Hadley's book!:

    print("it is OK")

    ## [1] "it is OK"

You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk
unnamed-chunk-2](./tesst_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-2.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
