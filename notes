% Introduction themes related to this: the presence/rarity of food web
% quantifications.  the large variation in ecosystem function (decomp
% rate) in bromeliads in this habitat (lecraw, unpub data).  does pred
% pd account for some of this? 


% Densities were calculated from 2008 dataset survey in two ways: the
% first, by poisson regression and the second, by taking the average of
% all bromeliads in between 90 and 200ml (n = 6???). 

%% how much fine detritus was added?

%% exactly how much coarse was added?  mean and standard deviations
%% for each.

%% Exactly when was the second addition of the larvae?

%%%% must add in the hypotheses section from Proposal.tex - but not to
%%%% keep it as a bullet list!  or just keep in the specific
%%%% hypotheses tested?
