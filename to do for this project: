One R file for each data type: so four: 

* phylogeny
* occurrence
* feeding
* experiment

NOTE there may be some inconsistencies in which tabanid species is called what.  worth checking carefully.  ie in occurrence matrix it is "green" and Tabanid B, but in phylogeny I think I called it A.  Or maybe in feeding trial data.  should'nt matter?
