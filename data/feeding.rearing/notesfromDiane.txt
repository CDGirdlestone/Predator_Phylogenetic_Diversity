Cardoso feeding trials – 24 h

Zygoptera sp A – ate red chironomid sp A, tipulid sp B.

Tabanid sp B – perhaps pierced tipulid sp B, not caddisfly

Corethrella – no effect on any of: redchironomid, smallercorethrella,
culicidae sp E, small scirtid (even after 80 hours)

Diptera sp C – observed piercing tipulid

Diptera sp A – had read in guts, presumed ate red chironomid

Tabanid sp b Green – definitely ate most of tip sp B, and pierced &
killed scirtid sp A

zygoptera sp A – unable to eat ostracod

caddisflies – observed skeletonizing detritus

Zygoptera sp A – did it eat caddisfly out of case? Unable to eat 2
othersin 2nd trial.

Zygoptera sp B 0.3 cm – ate ceratopogonid sp B

Tabanid sp B green (medium) – ate syrphid sp B (black-tipped).. just
'carapace' left/

Corethrella – ate 1 very small Culex

Leech (green spots) – did NOT each small tipulid sp B

Tanypodine – Did NOT eat 2 tiny red chironomid sp A

Black-headed Diptera sp E + tanypodine = Diptera E alive, tanypodine
misssing (presumed eaten)

Corethrella _+ Tanypodine - both still alive.

Tabanid sp A (white) + red chironomid sp A- rc dead, tabanid alive.

Tabanid + 2 caddisflies = both still alive

Other combinations that had no mortality:

Dipter cp C + scirtid Corethrella + 2 culex blackhead Diptera E and
tiny tipulid blackhead Diptera E +scirtid ( tried two times)

Diptera sp A+ Scirtidaer Diptera sp A + tipulid
